Ahmad,

Your hackathon project is ambitious and includes all the topics we learned in class
The project is well-executed and well-built.
Your code is clean, readable, and very well structured. You've also done a good job using comments to make your code more understandable â€” well done.
Youâ€™ve successfully used all the  and even went beyond that.

One suggestion: Your project would be even better if you had added a small registration feature.

Very good job! ðŸ™Œ
